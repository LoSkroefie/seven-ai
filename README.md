# Seven

**She talks. She listens. She has free will.**  
Local companion on your PC — not a slash-command console.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Version** | 4.3.0 Beta; completion evidence is tracked in `docs/COMPLETION_LEDGER.md` |
| **Brain** | `qwen2.5:7b` (auto) · voice **en-US-AvaNeural** |
| **Runtime** | Python 3.11+ · Ollama |
| **Primary UX** | `python -m seven --talk` / `run_seven.bat` |
| **Autonomy** | Free will + tools (L4) when *she* decides |

> Old v3 code is preserved under [`_legacy/v3/`](_legacy/v3/) as recovery material. It is not a supported runtime and is being inventoried before pruning.

## Quick start — just talk

```bat
cd C:\Users\USER-PC\seven-ai
python -m pip install -r requirements-real.txt
ollama pull llama3.2

run_seven.bat
```

Speak into the mic. She answers out loud.  
While you’re quiet she may invent goals and act — **you never type `/work`**.

| Launcher | Mode |
|---|---|
| **`run_seven.bat`** | **Talk (primary)** |
| `run_seven_daemon.bat` | Always-on free will in background |
| `run_seven_gui.bat` | Window + mic button |
| `python -m seven --cli` | Power-user text only |

```bat
python -m seven --talk
python -m seven --daemon
```

## What Seven actually does

- **Agent loop**: perceive → tool calls → act → remember  
- **77 built-in registered tools**: shell, files, screen/mouse/keyboard, web, vision, Python, clipboard, notifications, goals/tasks, extensions, Ollama lifecycle, coding CLIs and acknowledged robot bus operations
- **Memory**: SQLite under `%USERPROFILE%\.seven\`  
- **Voice** (opt-in): edge-tts + Whisper PTT — [docs/VOICE.md](docs/VOICE.md)  
- **Vision**: `see_screen` / webcam / presence — [docs/VISION.md](docs/VISION.md)  
- **Autonomy**: goals, work sessions, heartbeat without greeting spam — [docs/AUTONOMY.md](docs/AUTONOMY.md)  

Not claimed: biological consciousness or “51 sentience systems.”
